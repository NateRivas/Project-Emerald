# Project-Emerald
This website is in progress. The general design is intended to be flexible for others to use for League of Legends tournaments and is supposed to make it easier for anyone to setup.

Currently, here is what you need for this to work:

on windows: install xammp, and run the apach2 webserver, along with the database. Login to the database and create a 'phplogin' database. Enter this database and add an 'accounts' table. Enter values for email, password, username, and ID (as a primary key)

on linux: install phpmyadmin, mysql-server, and apache2. Set these up. Add the same table and DB as the windows setup.

website will by default be hosted at http://localhost:80 and http://localhost:80/phpmyadmin

More detailed instructions will follow in the future
